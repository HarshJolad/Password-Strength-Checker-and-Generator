# Password Strength Checker and Generator

A basic **Python**-based password strength checker that evaluates the strength of a password based on specific criteria and provides suggestions for improving weak passwords. 

## Introduction
This password strength checker is a command-line tool written in Python. It allows users to input a password and evaluates its strength based on the following criteria:

- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one special character
- Minimum length of 8 characters

The password is then assigned a strength score based on how many of these criteria it meets. If the password does not meet the minimum criteria, the tool suggests a strong password for the user.
